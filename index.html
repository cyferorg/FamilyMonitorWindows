<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Family Monitor is a very simple app that works alongside Google Maps. Most of the configuration that Family Monitor uses is set through the Google Maps interface either via the Maps browser interface or the Maps app. Firstly ask your family and family to allow Google Maps to share their locations with you (<A href="#Mapssetup">see below</A>) and then use Google Maps to define locations that will be used to configure Family Monitor alerts, for example the location of your home and of your children's school.</p>
<p>Within Family Monitor define the alarms you require which are in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suwon is further than 800m from home.
<li>James is closer than 2km from the library.
<li>Suwon is further than 500m from Me.
<li>Me is closer than 20km from the office.
</ul>
<p>Note that you refer to yourself as Me. And that's it!</p>

<a id="Settings"></a>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The following can be found on the settings page which is accessible via the cog button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check frequency
<p>How frequently to request an update of your family's locations from Google. A value lower than every two minutes is not possible.</p>
<li>Alarm Auto Reset
<p>Whether to automatically reset an alarm. For example, if an alarm is set to fire when James is closer than 100m from home:</p>
<ol>
<li> Alarm fires when James is closer than 100m from home
<li> Later James becomes further than 100m from home
<li> Later still James is again closer than 100m from home, if the alarm auto resets, the alarm will fire again. If the alarm does not auto reset then no new alarm will fire.
<br>
<br>
</ol>
<li>Alarm Reset Period
<p>How long to wait before resetting the alarm. In the above example, the Alarm Reset Period is, at step 2, how long James has to be further than 100m from home before the alarm auto resets.</p>

<li>Units of Distance
<p>Whether the metric or imperial system should be used.</p>
</ul>
<a id="Privacy"></a>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Family Monitor does not ask for, process or store any personal information. In addition, the only network communication is to addresses (URLs) within the Google.com domain.</p>

<h2>Google Maps Configuration</h2>
<p>There are two things that need to be configured on Google Maps for Family Monitor to work effectively, both of which you may already have set up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Location sharing - those family members you wish to monitor must share their location with you. The sharing may be for a limited period or indefinitely. In the latter case, the family member may remove the sharing of their location at any time without notifying you, though you will obviously notice that their location is no longer being shared. Let us assume you wish to monitor your son's location. You can either directly ask your son to go into Google Maps (using their phone, tablet, laptop etc) and configure Maps to share their location with you, or you can go into Google Maps and send an invitation to your son to share their location. Detailed instructions can be found by googling or, for example, <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7326816">here</a>.

</p>
<li>Location bookmarks - these are the geographic locations created in Google Maps that will be available to Family Monitor for defining alert rules, for example, "my son is more than 2km from his school". The location of the school is defined in Google Maps and then used by Family Monitor. These locations can be created either using the Google Maps interface to save the desired locations to the <i>Starred Places</i> list or directly within Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/bookmarks">bookmarks page</a>. For the former, within Google Maps, find the required location, long press the location, tap the name or address that pops-up, tap Save and then save to the Google Maps "Starred places" list. (More detailed instructions can be found by googling or, for example, <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3184808">here</a>). The location must be saved to the <i>Starred places</i> list for the location to show up in Family Monitor.

<a id="FAQ"></a>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change Google account - Uninstall Family Monitor, reinstall it and then choose the desired account during start up.
<li>Give a location a better (more descriptive) name in the list of objects - using a browser, go to the <a href="https://www.google.com/bookmarks">Google bookmarks page</a>, click Edit for the desired location and enter whatever you want in the Name field. 
</ul>
